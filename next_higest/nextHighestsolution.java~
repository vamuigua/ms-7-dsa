Pseudo code:
//select a random number say 34722641
//split the number into two e.g '34722' '641'
//select the last digit in the first sequence 3472(2)
//find the smallest digit in the second sequence that is larger than it i.e 6(4)1
//Swap them,therefore the number is 3472(4) 6(2)1
//sort the second sequence to increasing number: '34724' '126'
